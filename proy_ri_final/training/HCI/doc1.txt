What is Human

Computer Interaction (HCI)?
 
Human

computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on 
the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between 
humans (the users) and computers. While initially 
concerned with computers, HCI 
has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design.
 
The Meteoric Rise of HCI
 
HCI surfaced in the 1980s with the advent of personal computing, just as machines 
such as the Apple Macintosh, IBM PC 5150
 
and Commodore 64 started turning up

electronic systems were available to general consumers for uses such as word 
processors, games units and accounting aids. Consequently,
 
as computers were

environments, the need to create human

computer interaction that was also easy 
and efficient for less experienced users became increasingly vital. From it
s origins, 
HCI would expand to incorporate multiple disciplines, such as computer science, 
cognitive science and human

HCI soon became the subject of intense academic investigation. Those who 
studied and worked in HCI saw it as a cruci

from the desktop to embrace the mobile world.

has grown to be broader, larger and much more d

itself. HCI expanded from its initial focus on individual and generic user behavior to 
include social and organizational computing, accessibility for the elderly, the 
cognitively and physically impaired, and for all people, and
 
for the widest possible 
spectrum of human experiences and activities. It expanded from desktop office 
applications to include games, learning and education, commerce, health and 
medical applications, emergency planning and response, and systems to support
 
collaboration and community. It expanded from early graphical user interfaces to 
include myriad interaction techniques and devices, multi

Despite that, some differences remain between HCI and UX design. Practitioners 
of HCI tend to be more academically focused. They're
 
involved in scientific 
research and developing empirical understandings of users. Conversely, UX 
designers are almost invariably industry

wealth of resource

academic audiences. Those of us who are designers also lack the luxury of time 
which HCI specialists typically enjoy. So, we must stretch beyond our industry
